## Security Best Practices

When using the LogicMonitor API MCP Server:

### Credential Management
- **Never commit credentials** to version control
- Use environment variables or secure credential stores
- Rotate API tokens regularly
- Use the minimum required permissions for API tokens

### Deployment
- **STDIO mode**: Credentials are passed via environment variables and never stored
- **HTTP mode**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Network security**: Restrict access to the MCP server port when using HTTP mode
- **Authentication**: When using HTTP mode, prefer passing credentials per-request via headers rather than server-side environment variables

### Updates
- Keep the MCP server updated to the latest version
- Review release notes for security-related changes
- Test updates in a non-production environment first

## Known Security Considerations

### API Token Security
This MCP server requires LogicMonitor API credentials to function. These credentials provide access to your LogicMonitor account. Protect them accordingly:

- Use Bearer tokens (recommended) rather than API key/secret pairs when possible
- Implement the principle of least privilege
- Monitor API token usage through LogicMonitor's audit logs

### Rate Limiting
The server implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. However, ensure your deployment environment has appropriate network-level protections.

### Input Validation
All user inputs are validated using Joi schemas. However, always validate data at multiple layers when building integrations.
